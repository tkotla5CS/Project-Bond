# Project-Bond

## Bond Research Project (Python & SQL)

This repository contains the code and resources for a bond research project using Python and SQL.  

**Project Goal**

Build a bond valuation model, Analyze historical bond performance, etc.

**Project Structure**

* `data/`: This folder stores the raw and processed bond data.
* `notebooks/`: This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and model building. 
* `scripts/`: This folder contains Python scripts for data extraction and potentially other functionalities.
* `sql/`: This folder contains SQL queries for data retrieval (if applicable).
* `docs/`: This folder can contain additional documentation, reports, or results (optional).
* `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python libraries for the project.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkotla5CS/bond-research-project.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment (if necessary):**

   *  If you're using a virtual environment, activate it before proceeding.

4. **Data Acquisition:**

   *  You may need to replace placeholders in the data acquisition scripts with your specific data source credentials.

**Running the Project**

* Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
* Each notebook is designed to guide you through specific steps of the project (data cleaning, analysis, model building, etc.).

**Project Dependencies**

* Python (version specified in `requirements.txt`)
* pandas
* [other required libraries will be added here based on the project]

**Optional Dependencies**

* SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
